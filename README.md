# THE-LIFESTYLE-INTERVENTIONS-AND-INDEPENDENCE-FOR-ELDERS-STUDY-DESIGN-AND-METHODS.
This project investigates health trends over time using **Linear Mixed Models (LMMs)** and calculates the **Healthy Eating Index (HEI)** based on LIFE Study data. Python was used for data processing, HEI computation, and LMM modeling, while R was used for generating visualizations across time, study arms, and racial groups.
